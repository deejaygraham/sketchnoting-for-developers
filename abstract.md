## abstract 
		
As developers the one thing we can count on is that we can never stop learning. 
Retaining, processing and making sense of new information are all parts of what 
we do every day. Sketchnoting is a set of techniques you can use to support 
and improve your visual thinking, communication and learning. You can even use 
it to get more benefit from the other sessions you attend at DDD North!

In this session, I will show you how sketchnoting works, how to get started, tips 
and tricks to save you time and why sketchnoting is so much better than F#. I'll 
also cover how it can be applied beyond conferences and talks to UX/UI design, 
team collaboration, agile methods and your personal development.
