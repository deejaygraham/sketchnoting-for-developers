# Introduction

Hi good morning, thank you for coming to ddd and this talk at too early oclock on a saturday.
My name is Derek Graham and I am a Principal Developer at Sage

<!-- Name the enemy - name the thing that's getting in the way of happiness -->
How many agile developers do we have in the room?

One of the big outward differences between "traditional" and agile projects is evidence of what 
are called "Big Visible Charts" or "Information Radiators".

Big graphics on the walls of a team space that show ideas for new features, 
what's being worked on, progress towards goals, UI mock ups, burn downs, kanbans. 

These things are in line with the XP value of communication and the idea of 
"Individuals and interactions over processes and tools".
 
And yet as a culture, little children are not self-concious when they draw, but as we grow up 
and get more "serious" and "professional" we are gradually encouraged to leave those 
childish things behind.

"All children are artists. The problem is how to remain an artist once he grows up" - Picasso

Thankfully, techniques like Visual Thinking and problem solving and Visual Notetaking are starting 
to be adopted by the agile community in all kinds of ways. This adoption, like most agile 
technqiues, is driven by their effectiveness for communication and learning, rather than tradition.

It's caught on to such a degree in the agile community, sketchnoters are being hired to work 
at conferences, capturing content as a way of documenting the presentations beyond video.

Corinna Baldauf, Claudia Sandoval and others even put together a little ebook of 
sketchnotes following the Agile 2015 conference in Washington D.C.

Atlassian (the company who make the Jira tool) are one example of a company who get everyone involved 
in conversations about how the software should look, behave, the priorities for work, and all 
the work is made visible on walls around the business. They use visual techniques for brainstorming, 
working out problems from user stories and lots of others. 
"The winner is the best idea not the best artist".

I have to thank Jeff Patton, who consults for Atlassian, for letting me use these slides.

What we know about how our brains store and process information mean 
that this is a growing field of study and will be increasingly important in the future.

As developers during our careers we will be called on to constantly keep our knowledge, our skills 
up to date and learn, unlearn and re-learn as fast as we can. We should take advantage of 
as many opportunities as we can to make that job easier.

Computers - Tom Gauld

I'm a developer working in an agile team and I should be drawing and communicating more.

What I'd like to share with you today is what I think of as the gateway drug, sketchnoting, and 
show your some techniques you can use in the rest of your sessions at DDD and I hope you'll be 
inspired to try using them in your personal and professional lives as well. 

Pattern on the stone - W Daniel Hillis

# Mary

In the late 90's I attended a c++ conference in Oxford which included a few sessions on agile, lean 
and XP. One talk was given by the fabulous Mary Poppendieck (picture) and it was a talk that changed my 
professional life.

At the time, the company I worked for were adopting lean production techniques for their hardware 
manufacturing and assembly but those concepts didn't make it upstairs to the software department. Mary's 
keynote helped me understand what those concepts meant for software. I still have the notes but another person  
couldn't tell you what they were about. It's only memory of the talk that tells me that she was talking about the 
Toyota Production System, what stop the line quality means for software and how we should emulate the mechnical 
looms of the Toyoda Weaving mills of the late 19th and early 20th century.

Many more times over the years I have attended important events and promised myself that this time, I'll take 
good, long form notes and definitely refer to them again, they will be so useful. But there they sit, still 
in a drawer, curling at the edges, yellowing slightly, unused and unloved. 
 
#What?

Someone who was equally frustrated with long form, hand written or typed notes was 
Mike Rohde, a UX and design specialist in the US. Mike has illustrated books for 37 signals (picture),
and started identifying alternative note taking strategies in around 2006 and went on to 
literally write the book on sketchnotes in 2012.

In the book Mike defined sketchnotes like this:

“...rich visual notes created from a mix of handwriting, drawings, hand-drawn typography, 
shapes and visual elements like arrows, boxes and lines.”

You should note that Mike didn't really invent any of these techniques, Visual Recording and facilitation have been
a thing since the 70s and I think drawing as an art form has been going on longer than that.

#Why?

Sketchnoting, is really about making notes more memorable, it's where you are NOT trying to capture 
every word and every detail but trying to get the big picture (no pun intended), helping you get a 
higher-level conceptual understanding and integrate ideas. It seems to be particularly suited to 
long-term recall (Kiewra & Fletcher 1984)

In ancient greece there are examples of stunning feats of memory and a number of writers compiled 
many techniques for remembering. Have you seen Benedict Cumberbatch in the BBC reboot of Sherlock Holmes?
Here he's often shown standing using a memory palace technique? He has put things he wants to remember in 
order around an imaginary version of a physical place that is well known to him. He can then recall the facts 
at a later date by walking through his memory palace and recalling each of the items int their place. 

Today if you ask a magician or mentalist or a memory athlete how they remember so much stuff - the order of playing cards, 
people's names... they will tell you they use a few techniques (many invented by the greeks) which rely on making 
powerful associations between the (hard) thing they want to remember - the order of a deck of playing cards and 
something easy to remember like a story. One technique goes that you associate the face 
and the value of a playing card with an icon - the 10 of hearts is a goose, the king of diamonds is 
Albert Einstein, the 2 of clubs is the eiffel tower - and you tell yourself the story of Einstein chasing the goose 
around the eiffel tower (which is a much better thing for your mind to remember) to recall the order of the cards. 

Science seems to be on our side in this, there have been several studies in recent years that suggest longhand 
note-taking is better than keyboard, and visuals are better than text for information assimilation and recall.

Aside from the obvious distractions of facebook and twitter, email, IM etc, writing by hand seems to form 
better links between what you are writing and the memory.

Williams & Eggert 2002 - found that the most effective way of taking notes is with an overall framework (the big picture) 
and embellished with critical specifics. That sounds an awful lot like sketchnotes.

In How Learning works in 2010 Ambrose, Bridges, DiPietro et Al looked at the differences between how 
novices and experts form connections and found that experts often learn faster because they have a 
better understanding of the big picture and can put new facts into perspective more easily with known data.

"Use of drawing caters to individual learner differences,
as a drawing is shaped by the learners current or emerging ideas
and knowledge..."
Ainsworth Prain Tytler 2011

Dreyfuss Model?

There's also the Dual Coding Theory - Alan Paivio proposed the idea that hearing the word apple, a person can 
write the word and also draw a picture of the physical object. Doing this meant that person was more than twice 
as likely to recall information when asked about the apple later. It seems that the word and the icon are 
stored separately but linked and either can be used to recall the memory.

There something called the Pictorial Superiority Effect, PSE - tests 2500 pictures shown to a subject for less 
than 10 seconds each can recall 90% of them several days afterwards. This recall falls to around 60% a full 
year afterwards. The reason text alone works so badly is because the brain actually sees text as lots of tiny 
pictures and though it can group them together into patterns of words, it is still much less efficient than a 
good picture.

I have three children and all three have gone through the same experience. They have an essay to write. When it 
comes to checking it before submission they have all been too embarrassed to read it aloud to check for 
errors. So simple spelling mistakes, words get transposed, all things that get caught by reading aloud. It's often 
reading aloud that stops you skipping words or auto-correcting in your head and lets you spot the errors. It's like 
pair programming for essay writing.  

Who has a rubber duck on their desk at work? Or knows why you would have a rubber duck on your desk? 

Have you ever had the experience of banging your head against a problem for so long you can't tell which way is 
right anymore but stopping and finding someone to explain the problem to (even a rubber duck or stuffed animal) forces 
you to express the problem in your own words and often means that you solve the problem yourself before you stop 
talking. It's creating that expression that does the work, not the other person. That's why you can use a rubber 
duck or any person substitute.

REFACTOR *******************************************

With normal notes, it's perfectly possible to write down everything someone says and not to have understood a word. 
When you sketchnote, it's all about active listening, not about winning a drawing competition. 
You are inventing a visual language to expand on traditional notes and forcing yourself to externalise what you are 
hearing and come up with your own interpretation. It's a more deliberate & slower way of taking  
notes that encourages better listening, meaning you will understand better, recall more and be able to communicate 
the information you consume. It forces you to make sense in your mind of what you hear, find a way to represent 
it on the page in a way that makes sense to you.

With sketchnotes, you are forced to externalise what you are hearing and come up with your own interpretation. That 
seems to help concepts be better fixed in your memory and also to help recall. It appears to be that engaging another 
medium in the process engages other centres of the brain to help make sense of the information and increases memory creation.


Evolutionarily, threats to our survival came to us first visually in the shape of a rapidly approaching tiger 
rather than a hand-written invitation - the tiger who came to tea. 

Words are only postage stamps delivering the object for you to unwrap - george bernard shaw

Senses designed to work together - so when combined in a learning environment,
images and text say, the brain pays more attention and encodes the memory
more robustly.

*Smell is especially important* - Look for mor examples

Interestingly, smell seems to play the biggest part in memory making and recall. Im not sure if a talk on Smell notes
would have got an audience!

REFACTOR *******************************************


# DDD North 2014

I was at DDD North for the first time in 2014 in Leeds.  It was the first time I had done live sketchnoting. I did 
three sketchnotes from three talks, Eve Baraba, Joel Hammond-Turner and Richard Dalton. I can still remember 
what those talks were about without referring to my notes just because of the sketchnoting process. It seems that once you 
have done the sketchnote you can destroy it or never look at it again and you will still retain some of the benefit. 
I did go to one other talk that day and didn't sketchnote it. I couldn't tell you who delivered it or what it was about.

#Fun

It's a fun thing to do and by sharing the sketchnotes on social media you can get great feedback from the 
community, speakers really love that you have taken the time to engage so deeply with their talk, and often you can continue 
discussions around the talks with other delegates far beyond the lifetime of the conference.

#Community 
				
There's a great community. Mike Rohde makes himself available on social media and is very supportive, the community in general 
is great, there is a weekly google hangout organized to talk about the minutiate of improving your craft if you are 
interested and there is a dedicated site: Sketchnote Army, that posts new sketchnoters all the time. 

#Why Not?

And why not? Short term factual recall - recording complete notes (meeting minutes etc) where factual correctness 
is more important than long term recall, normal typed or handwritten notes are better for these. 


# My Equipment

Let's talk quickly about my equipment. I am totally analogue in my approach. I carry a sketchbook with me 
everywhere, the brand isn't important - I choose them based on how thick the paper is so it doesn't let 
the ink bleed through the page so you can write on both sides.
 
Pic of pens and book

I can get by with the pen in the middle which is a good general purpose one but I also have a thicker 
pen for filling in large areas of black more easily. I have an orange-red for highlighting and a light 
grey for adding shadows. There's also a *Secret is in this picture* - ask about it later

I always use plain paper but if you aren't as confident in laying out your work, grid paper works fine too.

Lots of people like to use digital devices. For me it's personal choice whether to use iPad, tablet or paper and pen. 
It should be something where the interface doesn't stop you getting the work done. I see it a bit like the 
debate over vim vs emacs or eclipse vs visual studio. Use what's natural and fastest for you. Do what works 
for you to the point where the tool disappears - it should not be in the way.

<!-- Identify obstacles and explain how to overcome them. -->

Let's talk about a frequent objection to sketchnoting. Anyone want to guess what it might be?

# But I can't Draw

Pic of retro advert...

This is a frequent objection to starting to draw anything.

Now ever since I had my talk accepted by DDD I've been monitoring some of you in this room and 
yes, you're quite right, you can't draw.

Well, you can't draw like MichaelAngelo with God and Adam reaching out to touch each other's 
fingers. It took him almost 40 years to finish the Sistine chapel. I hope no talk you ever attend 
has to last that long.

If you google sketchnotes you will see some posted by professional illustrators that are super pretty.
I often see Mike Rohde (the pro designer) and think I want to give up.

So maybe we can't draw like Michael Angelo and we can't draw like Mike Rohde.

But maybe you could compare against a rubbish artist like Pablo Picasso.

Owl,
Bull,
Dog

It's really just lines and curves and circles and stuff put together, isn't it?

Maybe you could compare yourself against Dave Gray, noted Visual Thinker and inspiration for Mike Rohde's work.

./images/dave-gray-mann-gruber.jpg

How about some cartoonists who work for a national newspaper? I've chosen the guardian in this case:

Tom Gauld - simple figures - convey meaning in posture and outline more than in faces or hands, feet. Pictures, 
icons and text are very sketchnote like, one of my favourite illustrators and had a big impact on how I try 
to draw figures.
./images/tom-gauld-sketchbook-1.jpg

Josie Long - her series of cartoons on how she would change the world, very simple figures, faces, text.
./images/josie-long-another-planet.jpg

Stephen Collins

Modern toss

Modern toss are super sweary but get their ideas across very quickly with very simple, scrappy pictures, very 
few lines and few words.

Finally, everyone's favourite web comic, xkcd by Randall Monroe, again stick figures and text.

./images/xkcd-whatif-tie-coin-toss.png


As rubbish artist Pablo Picasso says:

Painting is a blind man's profession. He paints not what he sees, but what he feels, 
what he tells himself about what he has seen. - Picasso.

Clearly these examples show that:

It's about
communication
not art
				
Jeannel King a graphic recorder has written an ebook you can get online around this whole topic 
- how to draw things that are "good enough", and communicate enough about your intent in low stress easy to follow way.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Basics

So the primary elements of any drawing are these:

dot, line, arrow, circle, square, triangle

If you can write your own name and make these marks with a burnt stick you can sketchnote.
<!-- If you can't do any of these come talk to me later -->


# Composition

All we do is put these shapes together to build other shapes.

 handwriting
 block letters
 Shadow
 Outline
 
 # People
 
Stick Figures - posture
Star people
Dave Gray people

 #Emotions
 Austin Kleon faces in boxes
 
 Colours
 
# Elements

# Text and Typography

A big part of sketchnoting is making your writing look nice. Using it to show relative importance
according to text size, placement and font - bold block capitals, script, lower case?

Bad handwriting? writing block capitals will slow you down and improve your handwriting with practice
Write like you are drawing - more appreciation for typography.

Practice several types of well type - block capitals, lower case, script, 3d when you get more ambitious.

lowercase most often
ALL CAPS
and double all caps
Script (not often)


# Type Errors 

I am really bad at writing block Y's and A's. They are never symmetrical and I always slightly dread doing them. Here's 
a tip to correct type errors. Use double lines or fill in parts of a character to even up type, correct kerning, even 
out letter height and sometimes correct spelling. 


# Hierarchy
Create a hierarchy using size and separation


use numbers for ordering


# Layouts
straight, columns, top down is easy
, meander, spider web, jazz

examples of layouts

#Structures

Radial
Columns
Modular
Path-Meander
Jazz

# Secret Weapon

If you aren't confident about judging where parts of your composition should go or not very 
good at spacing stuff out, get yourself a blue pencil (as seen in the photo) - it gives you 
just enough help to see what you are doing but doesn't show up well against black ink and doesn't show 
up very well on photographs. I got that tip from a comic artist who uses a blue pencil all the time 
to mock out where figures are going to be. When the final art work is scanned, the blue is so feint 
it doesn't show up - particularly in b&W

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

So let's talk about how to get started sketchnoting a presentation like the ones 
we will be seeing today...

Grids, tables - the 5 things I know about GitHub
Big Idea with lots of bits around the outside (mindmap like)
Journey/stories/steps 1...2..3.


#Hello, World

Find out what the title is, and the speaker and fill those in first. Off to a good start.
Listen to the first few remarks and try to judge what kind of layout you should use - is this 
10 things I hate about..., is it a meandering recollection of past events...?

Remember that this is a plan and if it doesn't match the reality of the talk, that's ok.

 #Structure
 
 title, twitter name, pic?
 
 based on talk 
 
 get key topics down - not too much
 
 Add highlights, details, accents, 
 
Pay attention, don't allow yourself to drift off.

Follow the speaker
body language, voice - not the slides - they are available online after talk

Don't boil the ocean

Listen for quotes - pull quotations

If you only had 10 tweets to describe this talk, what would you use 
them to tweet about ? 

Technical talks - Don't capture code.
Sasha Chua
Listen for advice, libraries, products, fine just to watch demo.
Tom Stuart, richard dalton
Tom Gilb

In quiet time, go back and draw associations and fill in details'
boxes and arrows to give emphasis' - hiearchy

Capture what stands out to you.

Skip bits that don't interest you

Jokes, quotes f-bombs - high emotion or excitement, dramatic pauses, 
metaphors and similies	
				
Quotes, things to lookup later, book references, unanswered questions

add decoration last - capture information in lulls or after add shading etc. when speaker is off 
in the weeds use time to fill in bits or connect.

(Find some examples -eva lotta lamm use of quotes)

Don't get all the detail

At it's most basic, it's writing and using boxes and lines 
to establish a visual hierarchy - what's important and what's less important.	 


Filter and focus on what's important'

Listen for things that mean someting to you.

Tweets

Embrace mistakes
Block out
Have a couple of fonts at your disposal

Whitespace is good.

# Use you active listening

Listen to what the speaker is saying, not what you think they are saying and without judgement. Ego. Listening gets better the more you 
practice it. Listening means you are thinking more about 
the subject and more likely to have questions at the end. 

# Listen to the presenter's early remarks

They will often list the topics they are going to talk about and this will give you an opportunity to plan how to 
lay out content on the page. 10 things I hate about javascript might give you an idea to use two rows of 5 columns, one
box for each of the 10 things.

# Use your Cache

If the speaker is listing important things too quickly, try writing just the first word or part of a word for each item 
then come back and fill in when you have a chance.

# Listen for metaphors and similies

Often speakers will suggest a visual to you with their language but also be open to the possiblitiy of possible misunderstanding. 
Often taking what the speaker says literally or intentionally misunderstanding can lead to ideas for visuals that make the 
original idea more entertaining to you and therefore more likely to form a strong association in your memory.


# Keep in mind how you learn

Do you prefer more words and fewer pictures or more pictures with just a few key words sprinkled about? 


# Keep it simple

Use basic shapes - bullets - lines and arrows, boxes and clouds to establish a visual hierarchy and give the correct level 
of importance to everything in your note.

# Create your own DSL

In the heat of sketchnoting a live event, you often can't spend ten minutes trying to think of the best way to draw a metaphor.
What will develop are a set of repeating icons that you will use over and over again to act as markers in your notes.

E.g. 
Lightbulb for idea
Something you disagree with or controversial could be an exclamation mark
A bang splat could be a surprising idea or a surprising fact. 
Book for reference to look up
Cloud for something to google

Over time you'll become more comfortable with these icons and fluent in drawing them. They become your "Visual Language" 
as sketchoting DSL if you will. They really are there to communicate with you personally so it's fine if they don't 
match someone else's personal "language" but used consistently the context will communicate with others.

Anyone reading the abstract for this talk will have noticed I mentioned in it that sketchnoting was better than F#. This 
was mostly a troll for Richard Dalton who is giving a talk on F# somewhere else in the building at the moment. But it really 
is true. This hand-written DSL you are developing does not involve a keyboard - therefore it's "untyped" and it is really 
only required to parse or compile on a single machine - your brain. (works on my machine).


use colour to draw attention to things - not everywhere


# Embrace your mistakes

Don't worry about spelling or drawing mistakes. You can come back and fill in letters, draw over bits that are wrong and 
mostly no one will notice in the finished note. If you make a mess, just accept it and move on - worrying about what 
you have done wrong will stop you capturing anything else the speaker has to say.

Cover them up
or repeat them - first rule of improv. repeat and make it look like you 
intended it.
Use patterns to scratch them out if required

Examples of mistakes


# Review

Towards the end of the talk, check whether you have captured the right things. Are the main points visible, 
do they stand out? If not maybe make them more visible with spot colours, boxes or banners, numbers

Is the flow of the talk clear? Can you do anything else to enhance the hierarchy and connect ideas together 
that were not obvious at the time.

Quotes? Put in speech bubbles or quotation marks.

Practice improves
Confreaks, youtube - no pressure way to practice - press pause


# Unit Test

Good to test our code. Test of a good sketchnote is that you can reconstruct the highlights
of the talk from your SN, to be able to recall the most important parts for you.
what are you going to remember and how are you going to remember?
		
If you can do this, you get a green. 

#Refactoring:	
	
Opportunity to refactor if you come up red. Use it 
as a learning tool for next time - Text is meaningless? Picture doesn't mean anything?
		
#Checking in

Share

After talk is done, photograph it and post to twitter, Flickr, PInterest.
Tweet presenter and use event hashtag. Shows you've paid attention and engaged. 
It's a good way to show appreciation for the speaker (and they love it)
and it can expand on and keep the conversation going after the talk, perhaps extending your 
knowledge or understanding further.

Had a lot of positive feedback from this (see more later).				

You can tidy up and scan them in if you feel like it. I do for my blog but I tend to do it 
infrequently and in batches rather than when I do them.

My live sn was at ddd north 14 and had some lovely conversations with the presenters after the conference was over

Corey Lattislaw - usually photographs at end but gets the award for most high-tech solution for using Google Glass to 
record her sketchnotes live and then share the still images and short vine-like videos on G+.

# My Contribution - In Reverse

Had to do a talk which included a fair bit of live coding and was pointless having a powerpoint I was 
constantly switching to and from. I still needed a narrative flow through the ideas and hate having 
notes jotted down - glasses - where I find I spend most of my time looking down and reading the notes to 
myself with long pauses. Didn't have the opportunity to rehearse very much either. So I decided to test 
the claim that the memory thing would work and I created sketchnote of what I imaginged someone who was watching
me would make. I then used this as my guide for the talk - it was easy to keep track of where I was in the 
flow without having to keep reading word for word. 
	
Hate live coding but couldn't get out of it but also hate not having notes. Getting old,
I can't look at screen and type (without glasses) and look at paper with glasses. 
Tried out idea that if our unit tests work, we should be able to fly using them on their own. 

And so was born the concept of Sketchnoting in Reverse. I blogged and tweeted about it and that was it.
The presentation worked beautifully and I had a lot of good feedback from it. I have since used it a few 
more times for other talks and sometimes to help me plan a talk.

#Some Cool things that have happened to me this year...
				
1. I did a SN of the first meeting of Michael Tiberg's FooCafe, where Dan North talked about deliberate practice.
Michael Tiberg (of oredev fame) contacted me and asked for a high-res version of the picture I posted on twitter.
They are going to use it for A1 size promotional posters for FooCafe around university campuses, co-working spaces etc.
They are being printed about now, need to get a picture of one in situ.

2. Paul Klipp asked for SN's for the 2015 ACE conference he organizes in 
Poland. I was picked to contribute and drew the short straw for Tom Gilb's data heavy talk on agile's roots
and his experiences of consulting with organizations. The procedings are available for donations from leanpub

3. I mentioned the SNW Mike Rohde produced in 2014. I talked earlier 
about my approach to SN backwards. After I published that blog post, Mike Rohde 
asked if he could include it in his book.

# Inspiration

Finally some sources of inspiration, no shortage on social media,
so find someone or a few people whose styles you like and steal icons and 
techniques you like. I often find that I find one thing I like and make a note 
to nick it, rather than the whole thing.

Try for one or more of the sessions today. I have the word of the organizer that 
nobody will kill you for trying. 

Post a picture sketchnote of a talk to twitter using #dddnorth or tweet @DDDNorth
(or come and show me so I can tweet it)

----
				
#Catch

I will pick at semi-random a winner who will receive a copy of Mike Rohde's new book
the SNW at the end of the day. If you aren't in the room for the giveaways you won't get it
and I'll pick someone else.

----

#Finally

I'll stop there. The rest of the conference is coming along soon and I should be drawing...

# Questions 


Not given this talk very much so there are bugs in it. If you find one please
let me know.

practice pulling out key points from a speaker

When you are doing it you are taking what you are hearing 
and hooking it to your internal frame of reference, learning is 
adding new information onto old information that you already have.

Writing - possible to write down word for word without understanding of content.
Also you hope you can make sense of it later who goes back to it?

VN - listen to what's being said and really hear and understand.
Come up with your own way to represent, text or images to connect 
what you are learning to what you already know. 

Find myself asking more questions at conferences - 


learned skill, cool to share but no one really needs to understand
What you are creating here is a programming language for your own memory
that's why it's so much better than F# ...
you are creating symbols that mean something to you that literally
compile only on your virtual machine
