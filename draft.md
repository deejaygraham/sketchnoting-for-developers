#Unit Test
		
	Good to test our code. Test of a good sketchnote is that you can recreate the highlights
	of the talk from your SN, to be able to recall the most important parts for you.
	If you can do this, you get a green. 

#Refactoring:	
	Opportunity to refactor if you come up red. Use it 
	as a learning tool for next time - Text is meaningless? Picture doesn't mean anything?
		
#Checking in
	
	After done, Post to twitter, tweet presenter and use event hashtag.
	Had a lot of positive feedback from this (see more later).

	My Contribution - In Reverse
		Had to do a talk which had no slides and had to do a fair bit of live coding. 
		
		Hate live coding but couldn't get out of it but also hate not having notes. Getting old,
		I can't look at screen and type (without glasses) and look at paper with glasses. 
		Tried out idea that if our unit tests work, we should be able to

#Some Cool things that have happened to me this year...
				
	1. Did SN of first FooCafe talk by Dan North
	Michael Tiberg (of oredev fame) and asked for a high-res version
	Going to use as promotional posters for FooCafe around university campuses etc.
	Being printed about now, need to get a picture of one in situ

	2. Paul Klipp asked for SN's for the ACE conference he organizes in 
	Poland. I was picked to contribute and did one for the lean pub 
	proceedings on tom gilb's talk.

	3. I mentioned the SNW Mike Rohde produced in 2014. I talked earlier 
	about my approach to SN backwards. After I published that blog post, Mike Rohde 
	asked if he could include it in his book.

#Try

Post a sketchnote of a talk to twitter using #dddnorth
(or come and show me so I can tweet it)

#Catch

Competition - books donated by Mike Rohde
Two best will get a copy of the SNW at the end of the day.
