Learning Quote

it's active listening, not about the drawing
putting down wht you hear onto paper
hear writing, not understood. If you put it through another medium you have to 
engage other centres of the brain to make sense of the information.
Any body had a proof reading thing? Rubber Ducking

Moleskine medium heavy paper - photo pens and pencils
*Secret is in this picture* - ask about it later
Plain or grid paper is best					
			
Even more lofi - brown paper bags.


#But I can't Draw

<h1>communication</h1>
<h2>not art</h2>

I've seen most of your notes and you are right
You aren't good enough to compare against Michael Angelo

Some from professional illustrators are super pretty
Mike - pro designer - give up

But maybe you could compare against a rubbish artist like Pablo Picasso
Owl,
Bull,
Dog

Picasso see against feel quote
Picasso Pics

Here are some examples from cartoons from the guardian.
Tom Gauld - simple figures - convey meaning in posture and outline
no faces or hands, feet

It's about communication and ideas not about the art

If you can write your own name and make these marks
dot, line, arrow, circle, square, triangle
<!-- If you can't do any of these come talk to me later -->

Composition
Use these shapes to build other shapes					
At it's most basic, it's writing and using boxes and lines 
to establish a visual hierarchy - what's important and what's less important.

#Hello, World
For talks
(getting started)

pay attention

Follow the speaker
body language, voice - not the slides - they are available online after talk

Don't boil the ocean

If you only had 10 tweets to describe this talk, what would you use 
them to tweet about ? 

Technical talks - Don't capture code
Sasha Chua
Listen for advice, libraries, products, fine just to watch demo.
Tom Stuart, richard dalton
Tom Gilb

In quiet time, go back and draw associations and fill in details'
boxes and arrows to give emphasis' - hiearchy

Capture what stands out to you.

DSL 
F# untyped language no keyboard involved, only has to make sense for you.

Works on my machine.
All about communication.

Skip bits that don't interest you

Jokes, quotes f-bombs - high emotion or excitement, dramatic pauses, 
metaphors and similies	
				
Create your own visual language (DSL)

Quotes, things to lookup later, book references, unanswered questions

(Find some examples -eva lotta lamm use of quotes)

Is it just for talks? Other uses - one technique to get you started.

Bad handwriting? writing block capitals will slow you down and improve your handwriting with practice
Write like you are drawing - more appreciation for typography.
				
layouts
straight, columns, top down is easy
, meander, spider web
examples of layouts
				
add decoration last - capture information in lulls or after add shading etc.
				
Embrace your mistakes
(examples)	
Smudges and spelling problems
Y and A can be cleaned up
				
Practice improves
Confreaks, youtube - no pressure way to practice - press pause

Filter and focus on what's important'

Book summaries

#Encoding & Memory
					
Sunni Brown
Good Enough
Eva-Lotta Lamm
Doug Neill


Brain Rules
Senses designed to work together - sow when combined in a learning environment,
images and text say, the brain pays more attention and encodes the memory
more robustly.
*Smell is especially important* - Look for mor examples

Merlin - Visualisation
Rule of Thumb - John Medina presenters.

#Unit Test

	Good to test our code. Test of a good sketchnote is that you can reconstruct the highlights
	of the talk from your SN, to be able to recall the most important parts for you.
	what are you going to remember and how are you going to remember?
		
	If you can do this, you get a green. 

#Refactoring:	
	Opportunity to refactor if you come up red. Use it 
	as a learning tool for next time - Text is meaningless? Picture doesn't mean anything?
		
#Checking in
	
	After done, Post to twitter, Flickr, PInterest.
	Tweet presenter and use event hashtag.
	Had a lot of positive feedback from this (see more later).				

share
with twitter,
use # and @ speaker
keeps conversation going after the talk
speakers love it
My live sn was at ddd north 14 and had some lovely conversations with the presenters after the conference was over
Shows you've paid attention and engaged'

My Contribution - In Reverse
	Had to do a talk which had no slides and had to do a fair bit of live coding. 
	
	Hate live coding but couldn't get out of it but also hate not having notes. Getting old,
	I can't look at screen and type (without glasses) and look at paper with glasses. 
	Tried out idea that if our unit tests work, we should be able to

#Some Cool things that have happened to me this year...
				
1. Did SN of first FooCafe talk by Dan North
Michael Tiberg (of oredev fame) and asked for a high-res version
Going to use as promotional posters for FooCafe around university campuses etc.
Being printed about now, need to get a picture of one in situ

./images/foo-cafe-site.jpg

					
2. Paul Klipp asked for SN's for the ACE conference he organizes in 
Poland. I was picked to contribute and did one for the lean pub 
proceedings on tom gilb's talk.

3. I mentioned the SNW Mike Rohde produced in 2014. I talked earlier 
about my approach to SN backwards. After I published that blog post, Mike Rohde 
asked if he could include it in his book.

(or come and show me so I can tweet it)

#Catch

Competition - books donated by Mike Rohde
Two best will get a copy of the SNW at the end of the day.
