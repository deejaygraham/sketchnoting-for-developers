# Introduction

Hi good morning, thank you for coming to ddd abd this talk at too early oclock on a saturday.
My name is Derek Graham and I am a principal developer at Sage

<!-- Name the enemy - name the thing that's getting in the way of happiness -->
How many agile developers do we have in the room?

One of the big outward differences between "traditional" and agile projects is the use of what 
Ron Jeffries calls "Big Visible Charts" and Alistair Cockburn called "Information Radiators".
Big graphics on the walls of a team space that show ideas for new things, what's being worked on, 
progress towards a goal - UI mock ups, burn downs, kanbans. These things are in line with the XP 
value of communication and the idea of "Individuals and interactions over processes and tools".
 
And yet as a culture, little children are not self-concious when they draw, but as we grow up 
and get more "serious" and "professional" we gradually get the feeling that it's not the done thing.

All children are artists. The problem is how to remain an artist once he grows up. - Picasso.

Thankfully concepts like Visual Thinking and problem solving and Visual Notetaking are starting 
to be picked up and adopted by the agile community in all kinds of ways. This adoption is based 
purely on the effectiveness of these techniques for communication and learning.

What little we know about how the brain works and how we store and process information mean 
that this is a growing field of study and will be increasingly important in the future.

As developers during our careers we will be called on to constantly keep our knowledge, our skills 
up to date and learn, unlearn and re-learn as fast as we can. We should take advantage of 
as many opportunities as we can to make that job easier.

I'm a developer working in an agile team and I should be drawing and communicating more.

What I'd like to share with you today is what I think of as the gateway drug, sketchnoting, and 
show your some techniques you can use in the rest of your sessions at DDD and I hope you'll be 
inspired to try using them in your personal and professional lives. 

Pattern on the stone - W Daniel Hillis

# Mary

In the late 90's I attended a c++ conference in Oxford which included a few sessions on agile, lean 
and XP. One talk was given by the fabulous Mary Poppendieck (picture) and it was a talk that changed my life.
At the time, the company I worked for were adopting lean production techniques for their hardware 
manufacturing and assembly but those concepts didn't make it upstairs to the software department. Mary's 
keynote helped me understand what those concepts meant for software. I still have the notes but I 
couldn't tell you what they were about. My only memory of the talk was of her talking about the Toyota 
Production System, stop the line quality and the mechnical looms of the Toyoda Weaving mills of the 
late 19th and early 20th century.

How many more times have I attended an important event and promised this time, I'll take good, long form notes and
definitely refer to them again, they will be so useful. There they sit, still in a drawer, curling at the 
edges and yellowing slightly. 
 
#What?

Someone who was equally frustrated with long form, hand written or typed note taking was 
Mike Rohde, a UX and design specialist who has illustrated books by 37 signals (picture),
started identifying alternative note taking strategies in 2006 and went on to 
literally write the book on sketchnotes in 2012.

In the book Mike defined sketchnotes like this:

“...rich visual notes created from a mix of handwriting, drawings, hand-drawn typography, 
shapes and visual elements like arrows, boxes and lines.”

#Why?

Sketchnoting, where you are not trying to capture every word but trying to see the big picture 
(no pun intended) helps you get a higher-level conceptual understanding and integration of ideas, is 
particularly suited to long-term recall (Kiewra & Fletcher 1984)

In ancient greek mythology there are examples of stunning feats of memory and writers compiled 
techniques for remembering things. Have you seen Benedict Cumberbatch in Sherlock Holmes where 
he uses the memory palace technique? He puts things he wants to remember in order around a physical 
place that is well known to him. He can then recall facts by walking in his memory through this 
memory palace and examining each of the items he has deposited. Today if you ask a magician or 
mentalist or a memory athlete how they remember so much stuff, they will tell you they use a few 
techniques which rely on making powerful associations between the thing they want to remember (hard) 
a deck of cards in order and something easy like a story. One technique goes that you associate the face 
and the value of a playing card with an icon - the 10 of hearts is a goose, the king of diamonds is 
Albert Einstein - and you tell yourself the story of Einstein chasing the goose (which is a much better 
thing for your mind to remember) to recall the order of the cards. 

Science seems to be on our side in this, Mueller and Oppenheimer 2014 - Study longhand is better than keyboard,
did a study on the recall and understanding of students when handwriting notes instead of using the keyboard. 
Aside from the obvious distractions of facebook and twitter, email, IM etc, writing by hand seems to form 
better links between what you are writing and the memory.

Williams & Eggert 2002 - found that the most effective way of taking notes is with overall framework 
and embellished with critical specifics. 

In How Learning works in 2010 Ambrose, Bridges, DiPietro et Al looked at the differences between how 
novices and experts form connections and found that experts often learn faster because they have a 
better understanding of the big picture and can put new facts into perspective more easily with known data.

Dreyfuss Model?

Dual Coding Theory - Alan Paivio proposed the idea that hearing the word apple, a person can write the word and 
also draw a picture of the physical object. Doing this meant that person was more than twice as likely to 
recall information when asked about the apple later. It seems that the word and the icon are stored separately 
but linked and either can be used to recall the memory.

Pictorial Superiority Effect, PSE - tests 2500 pictures shown to a subject for less than 10 seconds each can recall 
90% of them several days afterwards. This recall falls to around 60% a full year afterwards.
- Brain Rules - John Medina. According to Dr Medina, the reason text alone works so badly is because the brain 
actually sees text as lots of tiny pictures and though it can group them together into patterns of words, it is 
still much less efficient than a good picture.

Had to sneak a quote from Deming in somewhere 
&ldquo;People learn in different ways: reading, listening, pictures, watching. 
W. Edwards Deming, the New Economics

It's all about active listening, not about winning a drawing competition, putting down what you hear onto paper.

I have three children and all three have gone through the same experience. They have an essay to write. When it comes to 
checking it before submission they have all been too embarrassed to read it aloud to check for errors. So simple spelling mistakes, 
words get transposed, all things that get caught by reading aloud. 

Who has a rubber duck on their desk at work? Or knows how to rubber duck? Have you ever had the experience of banging your 
head against a problem for so long you can't tell which way is right anymore but stopping and finding someone to 
explain the problem to (even a rubber duck or stuffed animal) forces you to express the problem in your own words and often 
means that you solve the problem yourself before you stop talking. That's why you can use a rubber duck rather than a 
real person.

With normal notes, it's perfectly possible to write down everything someone says and not to have understood a word. 
With sketchnotes, you are forced to externalise what you are hearing and come up with your own interpretation. That 
seems to help concepts be better fixed in your memory and also to help recall. It appears to be that engaging another 
medium in the process engages other centres of the brain to help make sense of the information and increases memory creation.

Evolutionarily, threats to our survival came to us first visually in the shape of an approaching tiger rather than a hand-written invitation
- the tiger who came to tea. 

Words are only postage stamps delivering the object for you to unwrap - george bernard shaw

Interestingly, smell seems to play the biggest part in memory making and recall. Im not sure if a talk on Smell notes
would have got an audience!


# DDD North 2014

In 2014 when DDD was in Leeds, I was at this conference and live sketchnoting for the first time. I did three sketchnotes from three talks,
Eve Baraba, Joel Hammond-Turner and Richard Dalton. I can still remember what those talks were about without referring to my notes 
just because of the sketchnoting process and that's not something I can say for most other talks I have been to before this.

#Fun

It's fun and sharing the sketchnotes on social media you can get great feedback from the community and speakers really love 
that you have taken the time to engage so deeply with their talk.

#Community 
				
Mike Rohde, Sketchnote Army,
Mauro Tosselli, sketchnoters in general, kind and generous of their time.

#Why Not
Short term recall

# My Equipment

I am totally analogue in my approach. I use a Moleskine notebook which I carry with 
me everywhere - not for the name but because the paper is nice and thick and I've found it to 
be one of the best at not letting the ink bleed through the page so you can write on both sides.
 
Pic of pens and book

I can get by with the pen in the middle which is a good general purpose one but I also have a thicker 
pen for filling in large areas of black more easily. I have an orange-red for highlighting and a light 
grey for adding shadows. There's also a *Secret is in this picture* - ask about it later
Plain or grid paper is best					
			
Even more lofi - brown paper bags and biros - Mauro on twitter a few months back did a whole series of 
tweets using the the least swankified technology possible to demonstrate that you don't need good kit 
to produce a useful artefact.

<!-- Identify obstacles and explain how to overcome them. -->

# But I can't Draw

Pic of retro advert...

This is a frequent objection to starting to draw anything.

Now ever since I had my talk accepted by DDD I've been monitoring some of you in this room and 
yes, you're quite right, you can't draw.

Well, you can't draw like MichaelAngelo with God and Adam reaching out to touch each other's 
fingers. It took him almost 40 years to finish the Sistine chapel. I hope no talk you ever attend 
has to last that long.

If you google sketchnotes you will see some posted by professional illustrators that are super pretty.
I often see Mike Rohde (the pro designer) and think I want to give up.

So maybe we can't draw like Michael Angelo and we can't draw like Mike Rohde.

But maybe you could compare against a rubbish artist like Pablo Picasso.

Owl,
Bull,
Dog

Painting is a blind man's profession. He paints not what he sees, but what he feels, what he tells himself about what he has seen. - Picasso.

It's really just lines and curves and circles and stuff put together, isn't it?

Maybe you could compare yourself against Dave Gray, noted Visual Thinker and inspiration for Mike Rohde's work.

./images/dave-gray-mann-gruber.jpg

How about some cartoonists who work for a national newspaper? I've chosen the guardian in this case:

Tom Gauld - simple figures - convey meaning in posture and outline more than in faces or hands, feet. Pictures, 
icons and text are very sketchnote like, one of my favourite illustrators and had a big impact on how I try 
to draw figures.
./images/tom-gauld-sketchbook-1.jpg

Josie Long - her series of cartoons on how she would change the world, very simple figures, faces, text.
./images/josie-long-another-planet.jpg

Stephen Collins

Modern toss

Modern toss are super sweary but get their ideas across very quickly with very simple, scrappy pictures, very 
few lines and few words.

Finally, everyone's favourite web comic, xkcd by Randall Monroe, again stick figures and text.

./images/xkcd-whatif-tie-coin-toss.png

Clearly these examples show that

It's about
communication
not art
				
Jeannel King a graphic recorder has written an ebook you can get online around this whole thing 
- how to draw things that are "good enough" in an easy way.

# Basics
If you can write your own name and make these marks with a burnt stick:
dot, line, arrow, circle, square, triangle you can sketchnote.
<!-- If you can't do any of these come talk to me later -->

# Composition

Obviously we use these shapes to build other shapes									

Picasso pic - built from simple lines				

# Elements

# Text and Typography

A big part of sketchnoting is making your writing look nice. 

Bad handwriting? writing block capitals will slow you down and improve your handwriting with practice
Write like you are drawing - more appreciation for typography.

Practice several types of well type - block capitals, lower case, script, 3d when you get more ambitious.

# Type Errors 

I am really bad at writing block Y's and A's. They are never symmetrical and I always slightly dread doing them. Here's 
a tip to correct type errors. Use double lines or fill in parts of a character to even up type, correct kerning, even 
out letter height and sometimes correct spelling. 



# Layouts
straight, columns, top down is easy
, meander, spider web, jazz

examples of layouts

So let's talk about how to get started sketchnoting a presentation like the ones 
we have today...

#Hello, World

Find out what the title is, and the speaker and fill those in first. Off to a good start.
Listen to the first few remarks and try to judge what kind of layout you should use - is this 
10 things I hate about..., is it a meandering recollection of past events...?

Pay attention, don't allow yourself to drift off.

Follow the speaker
body language, voice - not the slides - they are available online after talk

Don't boil the ocean

If you only had 10 tweets to describe this talk, what would you use 
them to tweet about ? 

Technical talks - Don't capture code.
Sasha Chua
Listen for advice, libraries, products, fine just to watch demo.
Tom Stuart, richard dalton
Tom Gilb

In quiet time, go back and draw associations and fill in details'
boxes and arrows to give emphasis' - hiearchy

Capture what stands out to you.

Skip bits that don't interest you

Jokes, quotes f-bombs - high emotion or excitement, dramatic pauses, 
metaphors and similies	
				
Quotes, things to lookup later, book references, unanswered questions

add decoration last - capture information in lulls or after add shading etc. when speaker is off 
in the weeds use time to fill in bits or connect.

(Find some examples -eva lotta lamm use of quotes)

Don't get all the detail

At it's most basic, it's writing and using boxes and lines 
to establish a visual hierarchy - what's important and what's less important.	 

# Keep it simple

Use basic shapes - bullets - lines and arrows, boxes and clouds to establish a visual hierarchy and give the correct level 
of importance to everything in your note.

# Create your own DSL

In the heat of sketchnoting a live event, you often can't spend ten minutes trying to think of the best way to draw a metaphor.
What will develop are a set of repeating icons that you will use over and over again to act as markers in your notes.

E.g. 
Lightbulb for idea
Something you disagree with or controversial could be an exclamation mark
A bang splat could be a surprising idea or a surprising fact. 
Book for reference to look up
Cloud for something to google

Over time you'll become more comfortable with these icons and fluent in drawing them. They become your "Visual Language" 
as sketchoting DSL if you will. They really are there to communicate with you personally so it's fine if they don't 
match someone else's personal "language" but used consistently the context will communicate with others.

Anyone reading the abstract for this talk will have noticed I mentioned in it that sketchnoting was better than F#. This 
was mostly a troll for Richard Dalton who is giving a talk on F# somewhere else in the building at the moment. But it really 
is true. This hand-written DSL you are developing does not involve a keyboard - therefore it's "untyped" and it is really 
only required to parse or compile on a single machine - your brain. (works on my machine).


# Embrace your mistakes

Don't worry about spelling or drawing mistakes. You can come back and fill in letters, draw over bits that are wrong and 
mostly no one will notice in the finished note. If you make a mess, just accept it and move on - worrying about what 
you have done wrong will stop you capturing anything else the speaker has to say.


# Using 

Is it just for talks? Other uses - one technique to get you started.

a course for Product Owners and there are details in the SNW.

# Unit Test

Good to test our code. Test of a good sketchnote is that you can reconstruct the highlights
of the talk from your SN, to be able to recall the most important parts for you.
what are you going to remember and how are you going to remember?
		
If you can do this, you get a green. 

#Refactoring:	
	
Opportunity to refactor if you come up red. Use it 
as a learning tool for next time - Text is meaningless? Picture doesn't mean anything?
		
#Checking in

Share

After talk is done, photograph it and post to twitter, Flickr, PInterest.
Tweet presenter and use event hashtag. Shows you've paid attention and engaged. 
It's a good way to show appreciation for the speaker (and they love it)
and it can expand on and keep the conversation going after the talk, perhaps extending your 
knowledge or understanding further.

Had a lot of positive feedback from this (see more later).				

You can tidy up and scan them in if you feel like it. I do for my blog but I tend to do it 
infrequently and in batches rather than when I do them.

My live sn was at ddd north 14 and had some lovely conversations with the presenters after the conference was over

#Some Cool things that have happened to me this year...
				
1. I did a SN of the first meeting of Michael Tiberg's FooCafe, where Dan North talked about deliberate practice.
Michael Tiberg (of oredev fame) contacted me and asked for a high-res version of the picture I posted on twitter.
They are going to use it for A1 size promotional posters for FooCafe around university campuses, co-working spaces etc.
They are being printed about now, need to get a picture of one in situ.

./images/foo-cafe-site.jpg

					
2. Paul Klipp asked for SN's for the 2015 ACE conference he organizes in 
Poland. I was picked to contribute and drew the short straw for Tom Gilb's data heavy talk on agile's roots
and his experiences of consulting with organizations. The procedings are available for donations from leanpub 

./images/ace-conference-2014-tom-gilb - keynote.png

3. I mentioned the SNW Mike Rohde produced in 2014. I talked earlier 
about my approach to SN backwards. After I published that blog post, Mike Rohde 
asked if he could include it in his book.

# Inspiration

Finally some sources of inspiration, no shortage on social media,
so find someone or a few people whose styles you like and steal icons and 
techniques you like. I often find that I find one thing I like and make a note 
to nick it, rather than the whole thing.

#Try

Try for one or more of the sessions today. I have the word of the organizer that 
nobody will kill you for trying. 

Post a picture sketchnote of a talk to twitter using #dddnorth or tweet @DDDNorth
(or come and show me so I can tweet it)

#Catch

I will pick at semi-random a winner who will receive a copy of Mike Rohde's new book
the SNW at the end of the day. If you aren't in the room for the giveaways you won't get it
and I'll pick someone else.

# How
Call on Internal library of images developed over time
that are quick and ready to go

practice pulling out key points from a speaker

When you are doing it you are taking what you are hearing 
and hooking it to your internal frame of reference, learning is 
adding new information onto old information that you already have.

Writing - possible to write down word for word without understanding of content.
Also you hope you can make sense of it later who goes back to it?

VN - listen to what's being said and really hear and understand.
Come up with your own way to represent, text or images to connect 
what you are learning to what you already know. 

Find myself asking more questions at conferences -

#But I Can't Draw

5 basic elements go together to make up all drawings
composition

learned skill, cool to share but no one really needs to understand
What you are creating here is a programming language for your own memory
that's why it's so much better than F# ...
you are creating symbols that mean something to you that literally
compile only on your virtual machine
(works on my machine)
and because it's hand drawn and no keyboard is involved, it's 
the ultimately untyped language !(groan)

# Use you active listening

Listen to what the speaker is saying, not what you think they are saying and without judgement. Ego. Listening gets better the more you 
practice it. Listening means you are thinking more about 
the subject and more likely to have questions at the end. 

# Listen to the presenter's early remarks

They will often list the topics they are going to talk about and this will give you an opportunity to plan how to 
lay out content on the page. 10 things I hate about javascript might give you an idea to use two rows of 5 columns, one
box for each of the 10 things.

# Use your Cache

If the speaker is listing important things too quickly, try writing just the first word or part of a word for each item 
then come back and fill in when you have a chance.

# Listen for metaphors and similies

Often speakers will suggest a visual to you with their language but also be open to the possiblitiy of possible misunderstanding. 
Often taking what the speaker says literally or intentionally misunderstanding can lead to ideas for visuals that make the 
original idea more entertaining to you and therefore more likely to form a strong association in your memory.

EXAMPLE



# Keep in mind how you learn

Do you prefer more words and fewer pictures or more pictures with just a few key words sprinkled about?
