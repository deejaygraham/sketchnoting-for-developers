#Start

Hi good morning, thank you for coming to this talk 
at too early oclock on a saturday  My name is 
and I am a principal developer at sage

How many agile developers do we have in the room?

One of the big differences between traditional waterfall and agile 
develpment practices is agiles use of big visible charts, UI and UX 
Mock ups, burn downs, all kinds of information radiation.

Concepts like Visual thinking and problem solving are starting to be picked up 
and adopted by the agile community in all kinds of ways.
As a culture we are often hinted at that or outright told that drawing is 
something little children do and serious adults and professionals are too 
grown up for that.

What we know about how the brain works and how we process information mean 
that this is a growing field of study and will be important in the future.

What I'd like to share with you today are some techniques you can use immediately 
(today even) to get you drawing more. 

#What?

Note taking reference

Learning Quote

it's active listening, not about the drawing
putting down wht you hear onto paper
hear writing, not understood. If you put it through another medium you have to 
engage other centres of the brain to make sense of the information.
Any body had a proof reading thing? Rubber Ducking

I've seen most of your notes and you are right
You aren't good enough to compare against Michael Angelo

Some from professional illustrators are super pretty
Mike - pro designer - give up

But maybe you could compare against a rubbish artist like Pablo Picasso
Owl,
Bull,
Dog

Picasso see against feel quote
Picasso Pics

Here are some examples from cartoons from the guardian.
Tom Gauld - simple figures - convey meaning in posture and outline
no faces or hands, feet

Modern toss

- Cave Painting

Jeannel King

It's about communication and ideas not about the art

If you can write your own name and make these marks
dot, line, arrow, circle, square, triangle
<!-- If you can't do any of these come talk to me later -->

Composition
Use these shapes to build other shapes					
At it's most basic, it's writing and using boxes and lines 
to establish a visual hierarchy - what's important and what's less important.

#Hello, World
For talks
(getting started)

pay attention

Follow the speaker
body language, voice - not the slides - they are available online after talk

Don't boil the ocean

If you only had 10 tweets to describe this talk, what would you use 
them to tweet about ? 

Technical talks - Don't capture code
Sasha Chua
Listen for advice, libraries, products, fine just to watch demo.
Tom Stuart, richard dalton
Tom Gilb

In quiet time, go back and draw associations and fill in details'
boxes and arrows to give emphasis' - hiearchy

Capture what stands out to you.

DSL 
F# untyped language no keyboard involved, only has to make sense for you.

Works on my machine.
All about communication.

Skip bits that don't interest you

Jokes, quotes f-bombs - high emotion or excitement, dramatic pauses, 
metaphors and similies	
				
Create your own visual language (DSL)

Quotes, things to lookup later, book references, unanswered questions

(Find some examples -eva lotta lamm use of quotes)

Is it just for talks? Other uses - one technique to get you started.



sketchote army for inspiration and posting new stories

Bad handwriting? writing block capitals will slow you down and improve your handwriting with practice
Write like you are drawing - more appreciation for typography.
				
layouts
straight, columns, top down is easy
, meander, spider web
examples of layouts
				
add decoration last - capture information in lulls or after add shading etc. when speaker is off 
in the weeds use time to fill in bits or connect.

				
Embrace your mistakes
(examples)	
Smudges and spelling problems
Y and A can be cleaned up
				
Practice improves
Confreaks, youtube - no pressure way to practice - press pause

Filter and focus on what's important'

Austin Kleon steal like an artist
Daily journal
Book summaries
				
				
Painting is a blind man's profession. He paints not what he sees, but what he feels, what he tells himself about what he has seen.‚Äù
-Pablo Picasso 


Why?

Notes on a Laptop - twitter, facebook, email distractions oh my!
					
Improve learning &amp; retention

&ldquo;People learn in different ways: reading, listening, pictures, watching. 
W. Edwards Deming, the New Economics
				
Dual Coding Theory - Allan Paivio 
				
Verbal and Visual info - brain rules ???
				
It's fun!

				
#Encoding & Memory
					
Sunni Brown
Good Enough
Eva-Lotta Lamm
Doug Neill


Brain Rules
Senses designed to work together - sow when combined in a learning environment,
images and text say, the brain pays more attention and encodes the memory
more robustly.
*Smell is especially important* - Look for mor examples

Merlin - Visualisation
Rule of Thumb - John Medina presenters.

#Unit Test

	Good to test our code. Test of a good sketchnote is that you can reconstruct the highlights
	of the talk from your SN, to be able to recall the most important parts for you.
	what are you going to remember and how are you going to remember?
		
	If you can do this, you get a green. 

#Refactoring:	
	Opportunity to refactor if you come up red. Use it 
	as a learning tool for next time - Text is meaningless? Picture doesn't mean anything?
		
#Checking in
	
	After done, Post to twitter, Flickr, PInterest.
	Tweet presenter and use event hashtag.
	Had a lot of positive feedback from this (see more later).				

share
with twitter,
use # and @ speaker
keeps conversation going after the talk
speakers love it
My live sn was at ddd north 14 and had some lovely conversations with the presenters after the conference was over
Shows you've paid attention and engaged'

My Contribution - In Reverse
	Had to do a talk which had no slides and had to do a fair bit of live coding. 
	
	Hate live coding but couldn't get out of it but also hate not having notes. Getting old,
	I can't look at screen and type (without glasses) and look at paper with glasses. 
	Tried out idea that if our unit tests work, we should be able to

#Some Cool things that have happened to me this year...
				
1. Did SN of first FooCafe talk by Dan North
Michael Tiberg (of oredev fame) and asked for a high-res version
Going to use as promotional posters for FooCafe around university campuses etc.
Being printed about now, need to get a picture of one in situ

./images/foo-cafe-site.jpg

					
2. Paul Klipp asked for SN's for the ACE conference he organizes in 
Poland. I was picked to contribute and did one for the lean pub 
proceedings on tom gilb's talk.

3. I mentioned the SNW Mike Rohde produced in 2014. I talked earlier 
about my approach to SN backwards. After I published that blog post, Mike Rohde 
asked if he could include it in his book.

# What?

Mike Rohde in 2006 defined them as:

Roots go back a bit further:

Visual Recording and Facilitation 1970's
Rachel Smith - lets group see their work, see connections, big picture and trends (information radiator)


Leonardo in the 1950's

Visual Thinking

Ideas not art

Dave Gray
"Your drawing doesnt have to be that good. Your mind will fill it in."

#Examples

Mike Rohde
Jenn Wicks
Rachel Smith

#Why?

Mueller and Oppenheimer 2014 - Study longhand is better than keyboard

Forces you to focus on the big picture (no pun) conceptual understanding,
integration of ideas, long-term recall
Kiewra & Fletcher 1984

Most effective way of taking notes is with overall framework and embellished with 
critical specifics. 
Williams & Eggert 2002


Differences between novice and expert are connections
How Learning works 2010 Ambrose, Bridges, DiPietro et Al

Dreyfuss Model

# How
Call on Internal library of images developed over time
that are quick and ready to go

practice pulling out key points from a speaker

When you are doing it you are taking what you are hearing 
and hooking it to your internal frame of reference, learning is 
adding new information onto old information that you already have.

Writing - possible to write down word for word without understanding of content.
Also you hope you can make sense of it later who goes back to it?

VN - listen to what's being said and really hear and understand.
Come up with your own way to represent, text or images to connect 
what you are learning to what you already know. 

Find myself asking more questions at conferences - 


#Structures

Radial
Columns
Modular
Path-Meander
Jazz

#Retention
Dual Coding 
Van Meter & Garner 2005

Ainsworth Prain Tytler 2011
"Use of drawing caters to individual learner differences,
as a drawing is shaped by the learners current or emerging ideas
and knowledge..."

(Picasso quote about what you see)

#Why Not?
Short term factual recall - recording complete notes (meeting minutes) is more important 
than takeing the notes - Williams and Eggert 2002

#But I Can't Draw

5 basic elements go together to make up all drawings
composition

learned skill, cool to share but no one really needs to understand
What you are creating here is a programming language for your own memory
that's why it's so much better than F# ...
you are creating symbols that mean something to you that literally
compile only on your virtual machine
(works on my machine)
and because it's hand drawn and no keyboard is involved, it's 
the ultimately untyped language !(groan)
    

Hand-drawn text 
Boxes
Flow

Typography - Fonts
Big, small, bold, different styles


People
Stick Figures - posture
Star people
Dave Gray people

use numbers for ordering
Pic of speaker

Create a hierarchy using size and separation


lowercase most often
ALL CAPS
and double all caps
Script (not often)


#Prep 
Do title before it starts and pic of speaker if you can

Save things that resonate with you or something to look up later

Icons
Label box with shadow
Clouds - Investigate?
Splat with Exclamation - challenge
Sequence Number in circle
Quotations
Flags

Lines and Arrows separate and connect
dotted lines, arrows, big arrows, 
headings 

conceptual objects not literal
repitition

groups of people
horses people and add details
Drawing negative is difficult

like mindmaps - iconic - mnemonics

Learning style - is it good for everyone - Honey & Meldrum


Grids, tables - the 5 things I know about GitHub
Big Idea with lots of bits around the outside (mindmap like)
Journey/stories/steps 1...2..3.

use colour to draw attention to things - not everywhere

No UML !!!!

Ivar Jacobsen useless icons

Cover them up
or repeat them - first rule of improv. repeat and make it look like you 
intended it.
